# flixel-visualizers

A collection of audio visualizers I've created using HaxeFlixel. They're held together with duct tape, hope, and dreams. I'm open sourcing this because I ❤️ open source software and maybe it'll help someone somewhere sometime.

Each visualiser is its own state and will require modifying [Main.hx](source/Main.hx) to access.

Collection of songs and visualizers created:

    - Note: The source code for this is held in a [seperate repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqknD7Vse_Y).
- [whimsi](#) - [(source code)](source/states/Whimsi.hx)
